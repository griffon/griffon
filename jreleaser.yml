  description: Next generation desktop application development platform for the JVM
  longDescription: |
    Griffon is desktop application development platform for the JVM.
    Inspired by Grails, Griffon leverages concepts like Convention over Configuration, modularity,
    and freedom of choice. The framework at its core is written 100% in Java allowing developers
    to write their own applications with only Java. Other programming languages such as Groovy and
    Kotlin may be used too, in which case additional capabilities such as builders and extension
    methods become available.
    Griffon supports 4 different UI toolkits: Swing, JavaFX, Apache Pivot, and Lanterna.
    Griffon encourages the use of the MVC pattern but it's not limited to a single interpretation,
    you can for example apply standard MVC, MVP, MVVM, PMVC and others. Griffon also follows in the
    spirit of the Swing Application Framework (JSR 296), it defines a simple yet powerful application
    life cycle and event publishing mechanism regardless of the UI toolkit of choice.
