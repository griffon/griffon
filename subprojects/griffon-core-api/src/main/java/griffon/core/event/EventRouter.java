 * An event handling helper.<p>
 * Listeners may be of type<ul>

 * <li>a <tt>CallableWithArgs</tt></li>
 * <li>a <tt>Object</tt> (a Java bean)</li>

 * <p/>
 * With the exception of Map keys, the naming convention for an eventHandler is
 * "on" + eventName, Maps keys require handlers to be named as eventName only.<p>
 * Some examples of eventHandler names are: onStartupStart, onMyCoolEvent.
 * Event names must follow the camelCase naming convention.<p>
