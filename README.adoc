http://new.griffon-framework.org[Griffon] is desktop application development platform
for the JVM. Inspired by http://grails.org[Grails], Griffon leverages the use of
the http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy] language and concepts like Convention over
Configuration. The Swing toolkit is the default UI toolkit of choice however others
may be used, for example JavaFX.

Griffon encourages the use of the MVC pattern. Griffon also follows in
the spirit of the Swing Application Framework (JSR 296), it defines a simple 
yet powerful application life cycle and event publishing mechanism. Another 
interesting feature comes from the Groovy language itself: automatic property 
support and property binding (inspired by BeansBinding (JSR 295)), which makes 
creating observable beans and binding to their properties a snap! As if 
property binding was not enough Groovy's SwingBuilder also simplifies building 
multi-threaded applications, say goodbye to the ugly gray rectangle (the bane 
of Swing apps)!

Grails developers should feel right at home when trying out Griffon. Many of 
Grails' conventions and commands are shared with Griffon. Granted, Swing is not
the same as HTML/GSP but Builders simplify the task of creating the UI.

Seasoned Java developers will also be able to pick up the pace quickly, as the
framework relieves you of the burden of maintaining an application structure,
allowing you to concentrate on getting the code right.
