GroovyEdit is a simple multi-tabbed file editor whose sole purpose is to aid
people in learning the Griffon conventions.

This application is a refactored version of the original code presented in
the book "Griffon in Action", as this one enables the Save and Close actions
in a shared menu.

This application exercises the following features
- multiple MVC groups
- @Bindable and @Listener AST transformations
- MVC group creation and destruction
- threading constructs
- usage of default imports

The original code is available at
http://code.google.com/p/griffoninaction/source/browse/#svn/trunk/chap01/GroovyEdit
