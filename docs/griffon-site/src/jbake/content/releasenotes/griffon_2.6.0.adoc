== Griffon 2.6.0 Release Notes

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies have been upgraded

 * org.apache.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.6
 * org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.18
 * org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j:1.7.18
 * org.testfx:testfx-core:4.0.2-alpha

=== Runtime

==== Lifecycle Updates

`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` are guaranteed to be invoked when an artifact is created/destroyed. Previously the runtime
would invoke `@PostConstruct` on a service during shutdown if the service was never used at all. Destroying an MVC group
guarantees that methods annotated with `@PreDestroy` are invoked.

==== EventRouter

It's now possible to query an `EventRouter` for its set of listeners. `EventRouter` instances also use a well defined pattern
to name the threads they may use internally.

==== @Contextual

Fields annotated with `@Contextual` now benefit from the following statregy to locate a matching key in the context:

 1. Use the field's name.
 2. If not found then use the value of `@Named` if the file is annotated with it.
 3. If not found then use the fully qualified field type.

==== JavaFX UI Thread Ready ObservableList

`JavaFXUtils` can be used to create an `ObservableList` wrapper that guarantees all updates will be pushed inside the
JavaFX UI thread. This allows models and controllers more freedom to change values without concerning themselves too much
with the needs of the view. You will typically define an `ObservableList` property on the model, update its values inside
a controller action (by default running outisde the UI thread). The view only needs to wrap the model property and pass it
to the widget that will consume it, for example

[source, java]
----
ObservableList threadReadyList = JavaFXUtils.createJavaFXThreadProxyList(model.getItems());
listView.setItems(threadReadyList);
----

==== JavaFX Action Properties

All properties beloging to `JavaFXAction` will pushe their updates inside the UI thread. This makes it for an easier
development experience when programmatically updating those properties inside a controller action, as there's no longer
a need to wrap update calls with Thread specific blocks (such as `runInsideUIAsync` for example).

=== Testing

==== TestModule Providers

Test cases may annotated any method with either `@TestModules` or `@TestModuleOverrides` to supply a list of `Module`
instances used as the set of all available modules (the first annotation) or to override a subset of all modules (the latter).
These annotations superceed the need to follow a naming convention, such as

[source, java]
----
public class SomeTest {
    @Rule
    public final GriffonUnitRule griffon = new GriffonUnitRule();

    @TestModuleOverrides
    public List<Module> modulesToOverride() {
        return asList(new TestModule() { ... });
    }
}
----

==== Functional JavaFX Tests

There are a handful of updates in this area. First, all methods may be executed in alphaetical order, carrying over their
state from method to method. If one of them fails then all other methods will be marked as skipped. This is the same behavior
found in Spock using the `@Stepwise` annotation. You must apply the `FunctionalJavaFXRunner` runner to the test case to enable
this feature.

`GriffonTestFXClassRule` can inject members on the running testcase. You will typically invoke this feature in a method
annotated with `@Before` (JUnit) or in the `setup()` method (Spock).

==== TestFX Updates

Both `GriffonTestFXClassRule` and `GriffonTestFXRule` now have the capability to locate a `Window` instance. There's also
a brand new `WindowMatcher` that can be used to assert the showing and focused state of a `Window`.

=== Buildtime

==== Additional Key/Values in application.properties

The `griffon` configuration block has a new property that can be used to define additional key/value pairs that may be
replaced in `application.properties`; for example

[source, groovy]
----
griffon {
    disableDependencyResolution = false
    includeGroovyDependencies = false
    version = '2.6.0'
    toolkit = 'javafx'
    applicationProperties = [
        'build.date'     : buildDate,
        'build.time'     : buildTime,
        'build.revision' : versioning.info.commit,
        'my.property.key': 'my-value'
    ]
}
----

The `application.properties` must define matching replacement tokens, such as

[source, java]
----
application.name=@application.name@
application.version=@application.version@
build.date=@build.date@
build.time=@build.time@
build.revision=@build.revision@
my.property.key=@my.property.key@
----
