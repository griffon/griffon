== Griffon 2.3.0 Release Notes

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies have been upgraded

 * org.apache.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.3
 * org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.12
 * com.google.inject:guice:4.0

=== Runtime

==== Testing

link:https://github.com/testfx/testfx[TestFX, window="_blank"] is the chosen library for testing JavaFX UIs. There are two modes
of operation: integration and functional. The difference strives in that integration allows mocking and bindings to be overridden
(like in unit mode) and the application instances is created for every single test; in functional mode no mocking should be used
and no bindings can be overridden, also the application instance is created once per testcase.

==== Resources and Messages

It's now possible to define an empty value for a resource or a message key. This is important to configure buttons and menus
that should have icons but no text.

==== Builder Updates

Threading methods, such as `runInsideUISync` are now available as explicit methods on builder instances. This enables easier migration
from Griffon 1.x where these methods were also available to View scripts. The JavaFX builder supports the construction of comboBox
nodes using an action as an argument, same way as buttons and menus.

=== Buildtime

==== AST Transformations

JavaFX support adds two new AST transformations: `@ChangeListener` and `@InvalidationListener`. They enable the registration
of `ChangeListener` and `InvalidationListener` on JavaFX properties, much in the same way as `@PropertyListener` works
with `PropertyChangeListener` and `PropertyChangeEvent`.

==== FXML Templates

The `griffon-javafx-java` template can now generate FXML files when a `view` artifact is selected.

=== Compatibility

 * Usage of `CallableWithArgs` in events has been deprecated in favor of `RunnableWithArgs`.
 * The `WindowShown` and `WindowHidden` events will send 2 arguments now: the name of the window and the window reference.
 * The injector API no longer requires a nested injector.
