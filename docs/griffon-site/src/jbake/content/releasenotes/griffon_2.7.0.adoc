== Griffon 2.7.0 Release Notes

=== Dependencies

 * org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.7
 * com.google.inject:guice:4.1.0
 * org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.21

=== Runtime

==== MetaComponent Factories

In the last major version of Griffon (1.x) it's was possible to create and inject an `MVCGroup` instance inside a Groovy
View as if it were just another builder node. This feature is known as `metaComponent`. Sadly this support was not working
properly until Griffon 2.7.0 fixed the problem. Now you can use `metaComponent` as expected.

=== Buildtime

==== Gradle 2.12+ Support

Previous versions of the `griffon-gradle` plugin did not work with Gradle 2.12 or newer due to some changes introduced in
that particular version of Gradle on how dependencies can be managed. Griffon 2.7.0 fixes this problem, now the plugin can
be used with the latest Gradle versions.

==== Kotlin Project Template

There's a new lazybones project template that targets JavaFX and link:https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin] as main language. The
name of this template is `griffon-javafx-kotlin`.
