=== Build

The build has been upgraded to Gradle 6.9 and relies on the link:https://kordamp.org/kordamp-gradle-plugins/[Kordamp Gradle] plugins.

It's no longer possible to use Lazybones to bootstrap projects. Instead, use the provided Maven archetypes. The guide has
updated information on how they may be used.

=== Compatibility
