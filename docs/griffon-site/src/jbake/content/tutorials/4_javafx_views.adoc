==  Agenda

This tutorial describes how to create JavaFX views using different techniques:

 * JavaFX API.
 * FXML.
 * GroovyFX.
 * GroovyFX and FXML.

The goal of the application is to build the same MVCGroup using different techniques for each View. Each MVCGroup
defines a `Tab` that the main View will host. The application looks like the following picture

== Creating the Application

We'll follow similar steps as explained in link:1_getting_started.html[Tutorial 1::Getting Started, window="_blank"] to
create a brand new Griffon 2 application. Assuming you've got SDKMAN, Maven and Gradle already installed on your system,
execute the following command on a console prompt, paying attention to the selections we've made

[source]
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.griffon.maven \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=griffon-javafx-java-archetype \
      -DarchetypeVersion={jbake-griffon_version_current} \
      -DgroupId=editor \
      -DartifactId=editor\
      -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
      -Dgradle=true
----

There should be a new directory named `app` with the freshly created application inside. At this point you can import
the project in your favourite IDE. We'll continue with Gradle on the command line to keep things simple.
Verifying that the application is working should be our next step. Execute the following command

[source]
----
$ gradle run
----

A window should pop up after a few seconds. Quit the application, we're ready to begin customizing the application.

== Customizing the Application

Because we'll be making use of GroovyFX we have to tweak the build file a little bit. Follow these steps to enable
compilation of Groovy sources in this application:

 . Open `build.gradle` on an editor.
 . Locate the `griffon` configuration block and enable the inclusion of Groovy dependencies, like so

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
griffon {
    disableDependencyResolution = false
    includeGroovyDependencies = true
    version = '{jbake-griffon_version_current}'
    toolkit = 'javafx'
}
----

[arabic, start=3]
 . Remove `compileGroovy.enabled = false`.
 . Add a dependency definition for `ikonli-javafx` and its FontAwesome icon pack.

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    compile 'org.kordamp.ikonli:ikonli-javafx:1.8.0'
    compile 'org.kordamp.ikonli:ikonli-fontawesome-pack:1.8.0'
}
----

Next, we'll setup the main MVC group (`app`). We only need the _View_, which means we can delete the following files

 * griffon-app/controllers/org/example/AppController.java
 * griffon-app/models/org/example/AppModel.java
 * griffon-app/resources/org/example/app.fxml
 * src/test/java/org/example/AppControllerTest.java

With these files gone we have to update the application's configuration so that the MVCGroup does not refer to them.
Open up `Config.java` and make sure that the configuration of the `app` group looks like this:

[source,java]
.griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----
.e("app", map()
    .e("view", "org.example.AppView")
)
----

Finally edit `AppView.java`; place the following content on it

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/views/org/example/AppView.java
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/views/org/example/AppView.java[lines=16..-1]
----

The main view creates a `TabPane` that will hold each one of the tabs. It also creates 4 MVCGroups during its
initialization. We'll setup each one of these groups, but before we forget we'll setup their configuration in
`Config.java`

[source,java]
.griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----
.e("tab1", map()
    .e("model", "org.example.SampleModel")
    .e("view", "org.example.Tab1View")
    .e("controller", "org.example.SampleController")
)
.e("tab2", map()
    .e("model", "org.example.SampleModel")
    .e("view", "org.example.Tab2View")
    .e("controller", "org.example.SampleController")
)
.e("tab3", map()
    .e("model", "org.example.SampleModel")
    .e("view", "org.example.Tab3View")
    .e("controller", "org.example.SampleController")
)
.e("tab4", map()
    .e("model", "org.example.SampleModel")
    .e("view", "org.example.Tab4View")
    .e("controller", "org.example.SampleController")
)
----

Notice that every group uses the same model and controller configuration. This is possible because we only need to change
the view for each tab; the behavior remains exactly the same. We'll setup these classes with the first tab.

[[_tutorial_4_3]]
== Tab1: JavaFX API

Let's generate the first MVCGroup by copying an existing one. We'll create a new set of files
for the `sample` MVC group, as follows:

[source]
----
griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java
griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java
griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java
----

Alright, good thing we updated the MVC configurations in `Config.java` already. The behavior of each tab is to process
an input value whenever the "Say Hello" button is clicked. This behavior is identical to the one described at the
link:/guide/latest/index.html#_sample_javafx[JavaFX, window="_blank"] section of the sample applications appendix found
at the link:/guide/latest/index.html[Griffon Guide, window="_blank"]. We'll reuse the Model, Controller, Service and
resources described in that section; so the application should have the following contents

.griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java[lines=16..-1]
----

.griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java[lines=16..-1]
----

You can manually create a `SampleService.java`

.griffon-app/services/org/example/SampleService.java
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/services/org/example/SampleService.java[lines=16..-1]
----

.griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties
[source,java]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties[lines=17..-1]
----

The final piece is to update the View. We'll make direct use of the JavaFX API. Of course the code will look a bit
verbose however the important thing to remember here is that you can use the JavaFX API at any time, that is, you're
not forced to build the UI using FXML only.

.griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab1View.java
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab1View.java[lines=16..-1]
----

Of particular note, apart from the standard JavaFX API usage is the configuration of the button's properties using a
`JavaFXGriffonAction`. Actions define a container for both behavior and visual clues that buttons and other action
enabled widgets may use to configure themselves. This view also uses the same trick we saw earlier at the
link:3_mvcgroups_javafx.html[Tutorial 3::MVC Groups (JavaFX), window="_blank"] tutorial, that is, a reference to the
`parentView` allows the tab to be attached at the right location and time. We'll use the same mechanism for the other tabs.

We're ready to move to the next tab: FXML.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_4_toc"] <<_tutorial_4_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_4_4]]
== Tab2: FXML

FXML is an XML format used to describe a JavaFX UI declaratively. You may use SceneBuilder or write the file by hand,
at the end it doesn't matter as long as you follow some naming conventions. The first is the name and location of the
FXML file. If the view is named `org/example/Tab2View.java` then the FXML file should be named `org/example/tab2.fxml`.
You may place this file anywhere on your sources as long as it ends in the application's classpath. We recommend you
use the `griffon-app/resources` directory though. Here's how the `tab2.fxml` should look like:

.griffon-app/resources/org/example/tab2.fxml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/resources/org/example/tab2.fxml[]
----

It looks like any other FXML file except that the button's id follows a naming convention. Notice that the controller
attribute is set to `org.example.Tab2View`. An instance of this type will receive all injections based on fields
annotated with `@FXML`. However the controller (`SampleController`)  will react to actions matching a naming convention,
in our case it will be a single action name `sayHello`. The Griffon runtime is able to match an action to a corresponding UI
node by using this naming convention. The `Tab2View.java` file defines the second half of this view

.griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab2View.java
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab2View.java[lines=16..-1]
----

The code is much simpler as we rely on the FXML file to define the UI; this file only needs to be concerned to finish
up the bindings and setup the `tab`, in a similar fashion as it was done with the first tab.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_4_toc"] <<_tutorial_4_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_4_5]]
== Tab3: GroovyFX

In a few words, link:http://groovyfx.org/[GroovyFX, window="_blank"] can be seen as a Groovy DSL for writing JavaFX UIs.
Instead of XML you use Groovy. This allows you to leverage a real programming language instead of just markup. We can
make use of Groovy support in a straight Java application such as this because Java and Groovy can be mixed without
any problems, as opposed to other popular JVM languages. This is also the reason why we updated the build file back at
<<_tutorial_4_2,step 2>>. The DSL resembles a lot the now defunct JavaFX Script language.

.griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab3View.groovy
[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab3View.groovy[lines=16..-1]
----

GroovyFX provides a builder class that can be used to instantiate nodes using the DSL capabilities delivered by
the Groovy syntax. In this particular view, the builder is used to recreate the same layout found in the other tabs. The
code looks like a cross between FXML (defining nodes and their layout properties) and the direct JavaFX API (defining
bindings right on the spot). The code for setting up the tab is exactly the same, albeit it looks a bit different,
actually, more streamlined, due to Groovy's property access feature.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_4_toc"] <<_tutorial_4_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_4_6]]
== Tab4: GroovyFX and FXML

The last tab deals with the use case of reusing existing FXML assets. If you already have an FXML file but you'd also
want to use Groovy to setup bindings and do additional work, you may use the `fxml()` node from GroovyFX to load the
FXML file. Then you can further enhance the view by using the GroovyFX DSL. Let's see the FXL file first

.griffon-app/resources/org/example/tab4.fxml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/resources/org/example/tab4.fxml[]
----

This file does not define a controller nor makes use of `ResourceBundle` resources, the reason being is that the `fxml()`
node is quite spartan at the moment: it does not aware of the Griffon conventions nor does it setup a `ResourceBundle`,
thus i18n resources can not be resolved properly. We'll rely on the Groovy view to fix these shortcomings.

.griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab4View.groovy
[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{javafx-app}/griffon-app/views/org/example/Tab4View.groovy[lines=16..-1]
----

Notice that all widgets with a proper `id` attribute can be accessed directly inside the block associated with the
`fxml()` node. These happen to be the widgets we're interested in, thus bindings can be set accordingly.
Another change seen in `Tab4View` is that this class extends directly from `AbstractJavaFXGriffonView`, allowing this
view to invoke the `connectActions()` method. Finally the `tab` is setup in exactly the same way as we've seen before.

This is the final tab that we need to setup in order for the application to work. You can run the application once more
by invoking the following command:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew run
----
