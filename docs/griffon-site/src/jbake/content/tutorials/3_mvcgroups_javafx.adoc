==  Agenda

This tutorial touches the following subjects:

 * Creating new MVC group artifacts
 * Instantiating MVC groups
 * MVC Group parent-child relationships
 * MVC Group lifecycle

The goal of the Editor application shown here is to provide basic editing capabilities for text files. Each
file will be handled by its own tab; tabs will be located inside a tab container.

NOTE: This tutorial is almost identical to link:2_mvcgroups_swing.html[Tutorial 2::MVC Groups (Swing), window="_blank"]
but relies on JavaFX as the UI technology. A icon:bolt[] icon preceding a section or paragraph will be used to denote
JavaFx specific content that differs from the other tutorial.

[[_tutorial_3_1]]
== Creating an Editor application

We'll follow similar steps as explained in link:1_getting_started.html[Tutorial 1::Getting Started, window="_blank"] to
create a brand new Griffon 2 application. Assuming you've got SDKMAN, Lazybones and Gradle already installed on your system,
execute the following command on a console prompt, paying attention to the selections we've made

icon:bolt[] Use the `griffon-javafx-java` template

[source]
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ lazybones create griffon-javafx-java editor
Creating project from template griffon-javafx-java (latest) in 'editor'
Define value for 'group' [org.example]: editor
Define value for 'artifactId' [editor]:
Define value for 'version' [0.1.0-SNAPSHOT]:
Define value for 'griffonVersion' [{jbake-griffon_version_current}]:
Define value for 'package' [editor]:
Define value for 'className' [Editor]: container
----

There should be a new directory named `editor` with the freshly created application inside. At this point you can import
the project in your favourite IDE. We'll continue with Gradle on the command line to keep things simple.
Verifying that the application is working should be our next step. Execute the following command

[source]
----
$ gradle run
----

A window should pop up after a few seconds. Quit the application, we're ready to begin customizing the application.

[[_tutorial_3_2]]
== Setting up the main MVC group

Each file we open requires a bit of metadata to be handled by the editor application, for example its title and contents.
We'll create a simple observable POJO that represents a `Document`.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.src/main/java/editor/Document.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/src/main/java/editor/Document.java[lines=18..-1]
----

The _title_ and _contents_ properties should be self explanatory. We'll use the _dirty_ property to keep track of
changes. The final property, _file_, points to the `File` object that was used to load the document; we'll use this
value to save back edited changes.

Now imagine what happens when you have multiple tabs open in an editor; the `save` and `close` actions are context
sensitive, that is, they operate on the currently selected editor/tab. We need to replicate this behavior, in order
to do so we'll use a presentation model for the `Document` class, aptly named `DocumentModel`.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.src/main/java/editor/DocumentModel.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/src/main/java/editor/DocumentModel.java[lines=18..-1]
----

The `DocumentModel` class extends from `Document` just as a convenience, it inherits all properties from `Document` in
this way. It also defines a new property _document_ which will hold the selected `Document`.

Alright, we can move on to the `ContainerModel` member of the `container` MVC group (our main group). Here we'll
see how the previous presentation model is put to good use.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/models/editor/ContainerModel.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/models/editor/ContainerModel.java[lines=18..-1]
----

This model keeps track of two items:

 . the identifier of the selected tab, represented by _mvcIdentifier_.
 . the document presentation model, represented by _documentModel_.

Notice that the _documentModel_ property is declared as final; this means it will always have the same value, thus we
can use it to create stable bindings. This is the reason for making `DocumentModel` a subclass of `Document`. As you
can see the former listens to changes on the latter and copying the values over. This happens every time the application
changes the value of _documentModel.document_ due to the ``PropertyChangeListener``s that were put into place.

icon:bolt[] Let's move to the View. Open up `ContainerView.java` and paste the following into it

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/views/editor/ContainerView.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/views/editor/ContainerView.java[lines=18..-1]
----

Here we find a `Scene` whose contents come from an FXML file. The file name is determined using a naming convention, in
this case it's the fully qualified View class name without the `View` suffix. These are the contents of said file.

icon:bolt[] Also, the `view` registers an anonymous `javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener` to listen to tab selection
changes and update the _documentModel_ property found in the `model`.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
[subs="verbatim,"attributes"]
.griffon-app/resources/editor/container.fxml
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/resources/editor/container.fxml[]
----

This file defines a `MenuBar` and a tab container (a `TabPane`) named _tabGroup_. This tab container is exposed
to the outside world via a getter method; we'll see why it's done this way when the second MVC group comes into play.
The View is also responsible for managing a `FileChooser` that will be used to select files for reading.

We can define a few of the action properties using a resource bundle, from the example the mnemonic and accelerator
properties. Paste the following into `messages.properties`.

icon:bolt[] There is no mnemonic support in JavaFX.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties[lines=19..-1]
----

We're almost done with the `container` MVC group, what remains to be done is update the `ContainerController`.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/controllers/editor/ContainerController.java
----
package editor;

import griffon.core.artifact.GriffonController;
import org.kordamp.jipsy.annotations.ServiceProviderFor;
import org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.core.artifact.AbstractGriffonController;

@ServiceProviderFor(GriffonController.class)
public class ContainerController extends AbstractGriffonController {
    private ContainerModel model;
    private ContainerView view;

    public void open() {

    }

    public void save() {

    }

    public void close() {

    }

    public void quit() {
        getApplication().shutdown();
    }
}
----

We've got 4 actions (`open`, `save`, `close` and `quit`) and nothing more for the time being. You can run the application
once again to verify that the code compiles and runs.

[[_tutorial_3_3]]
== Generating an Editor MVC group

You can create new artifact files by hand, just by copying existing one. But you can also let Lazybones generate these
files for you. Lazybones ability to generate additional files well after the project's creation is what sets it apart
from Maven's archetype solution. Lazybones has a feature called _subtemplates_ or _generators_; these are regular
template files with the added distinction that they have been hidden inside the project's sources (actually inside
`.lazybones`, local to the project). Unfortunately as of version 0.8 Lazybones does not have a command that can list
existing subtemplates, however Griffon only exposes one by default, its name is _artifact_.

Armed with this information we can generate new artifacts by invoking the following command

[source]
----
$ lazybones generate artifact

The following artifact templates are available

  controller
  integrationspec
  integrationtest
  model
  service
  spec
  test
  view
  mvcgroup

Which type of artifact do you want to generate? mvcgroup
Define value for 'package' [editor]:
Define value for 'class' name: editor
Created new artifact griffon-app/models/editor/EditorModel.java
Created new artifact griffon-app/views/editor/EditorView.java
Created new artifact griffon-app/controllers/editor/EditorController.java
Created new artifact src/test/java/editor/EditorControllerTest.java
Created new artifact src/integration-test/java/editor/EditorIntegrationTest.java
Do not forget to add the group 'editor' to griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----

We select the `mvcgroup` option. Notice that Lazybones remembered the default package we used when we created the
application. We select `editor` as the name of the new MVC group. There are 5 new files generated using the
default templates. Take special care of the last message; the files were created but this doesn't mean the application
will be able to instantiate the MVC group at runtime. The final piece of the puzzle is letting the application know
about this new MVC group, this is done by editing `Config.java`

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/conf/Config.java[lines=18..-1]
----

Great, we have the basics for this new MVC group ready. Now let's make it work.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_3_toc"] <<_tutorial_3_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_3_4]]
== Setting up the Editor MVC group

We'll begin by looking at the Model again. This time the model will hold the actual `Document` that this group will
edit.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/models/editor/EditorModel.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/models/editor/EditorModel.java[lines=18..-1]
----

Just a basic observable model with a single _document_ property. Things get interesting once we move to the View,
as is its responsibility to display the file's contents. One thing that must happen at some point is the new tab
being added to the tab container. We can make this happen at the point where an instance of the `editor` MVC group
is created; this requires the `EditorView` to expose its tab somehow. Or we can keep this behavior local to this
group and make sure that this View handles adding and removing the tab. This is the reason why we exposed the _tabGroup_
field in `ContainerView`. Let's look at the `EditorView`, shall we?

icon:bolt[] The `EditorView` relies on FXML to create the nodes.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/views/editor/EditorView.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/views/editor/EditorView.java[lines=18..-1]
----

And the corresponding FXML file for this View

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
[subs="verbatim,"attributes"]
.griffon-app/resources/editor/editor.fxml
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/resources/editor/editor.fxml[]
----

Take special note in the usages of the _parentView_ field. Notice that the type is set to `ContainerView`,
this means this View is aware that it's not a top level MVC group, that is, there will be another MVC group that
is responsible for instantiating `editor`, in this case it is the `container` MVC group. A parent/child
relationship is established between the two MVC group instances when this happens. More information about this
relationship can be found at the link:/guide/latest/index.html#_mvc_mvc_group_relationships[guide, window="_blank"].

Because this View is responsible for attaching the tab when ready it should also be responsible for detaching said tab
when the group is no longer in use. We'll use the `mvcGroupDestroy()` lifecycle method to achieve this goal. Also,
the tab component saves the group's identifier into a client property. This is the link that the `ContainerModel` uses
to switch between active tabs.

Last but not least, we update the `EditorController` to take care of loading the document, saving any changes and
closing the tab.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/controllers/editor/EditorController.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/controllers/editor/EditorController.java[lines=18..-1]
----

Invoking the `closeFile()` action triggers the destruction of this MVC group, which in turns calls the
`mvcGroupDestroy()` lifecycle method on all MVC instances, such as the View; this will automatically remove the tab
from the tab container as expected.

Don't forget to add the following dependency to `build.gradle`!

[source,groovy]
----
compile 'commons-io:commons-io:2.5'
----

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_3_toc"] <<_tutorial_3_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_3_5]]
== Instantiating the Editor MVC group

We go back to the `ContainerController` to add some more behavior to it. Now that we know the `EditorView` expects a
`ContainerView` as parent it makes sense for the `ContainerController` to instantiate the `editor` group. We'll do
this in the `open` action.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/controllers/editor/ContainerController.java
----
public void open() {
    File file = view.selectFile();
    if (file != null) {
        String mvcIdentifier = file.getName() + "-" + System.currentTimeMillis();
        createMVC("editor", mvcIdentifier, CollectionUtils.<String, Object>map()
            .e("document", new Document(file, file.getName()))
            .e("tabName", file.getName()));
    }
}
----

Now the pieces start to fall into their rightful place. Because the `editor` MVC group takes care of attaching and
detaching itself the code in the `container` controller is much simpler, it just needs to create a new instance of
the `editor` group and that's it!

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_3_toc"] <<_tutorial_3_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_3_6]]
== Finishing up the main MVC group

We're ready to make the final adjustments to this application, by adding the missing behavior to the
`ContainerController`, that is, the code for `save` and `close` actions.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.griffon-app/controllers/editor/ContainerController.java
----
include::{editor-javafx-java}/griffon-app/controllers/editor/ContainerController.java[lines=18..-1]
----

Here we see another interesting feature of the Griffon runtime. Every instance of an MVC group is tracked by the
`MVCGroupManager`, this means we can search for a group as long as we know its id. This is why we store the selected
_mvcIdentifier_ in `ContainerModel`. The `save` and `close` actions are _global_, they are defined by the `container`
group, but they must act upon a special context, the selected tab handled by an instance of the `editor` group.
We accomplish this task by remembering the group id associated with a tab whenever its selected; this id is used to
find the correct `editor` group instance and perform actions on it.

The full code for this application can be found
link:https://github.com/griffon/griffon/tree/master/samples/editor-javafx-java[here, window="_blank"].
