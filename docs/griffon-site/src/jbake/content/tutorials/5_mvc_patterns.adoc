== Agenda

This tutorial describes how to leverage different MVC patterns, such as

 * Model - View - Controller
 * Model - View - Presenter
 * Model - View - ViewModel
 * PresentationModel - View - Controller

The goal is to build the same application using different patterns.

=== MVC: Model-View-Controller

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller]

Perhaps the most well known pattern, also the one that many will get wrong and implement in an even worse way. The MVC
pattern arose as a solution to keep 3 concerns separate from each other: visuals (*View*), data (*Model*), and logic
(*Controller*). The pattern is easy to understand but hard to implement given that its generic description: a triangle
where all parts can communicate with each other. Problem is, the links between some parts may be passive, for example
some claim the *View* may only read the *Model* but do not update it directly, where as others claim data flows equally
both ways.

The following diagram presents one of the many ways in which this pattern may be implemented; the dotted lines represent
passive links.

=== MVP: Model-View-Presenter

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-presenter]

This pattern emerged as a counterpoint for MVC, trying to solve the triangle problem. In this pattern the *View* is passive
and only reacts to data sent by the *Presenter*, which came from the *Model*. The *View* can route user events to the
*Presenter* but does not know the *Model*. The *Model* in turn receives updates from the *Presenter* and notifies it of
any state changes, resulting in an isolated *Model*. Only the *Presenter* knows the other two members of the pattern.

=== MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-viewmodel]

The MVVM pattern is a weird variation if you ask me, as it puts the logic between the *View* and the *ViewModel*. The
*ViewModel* is responsible for abstracting all *View* input/outputs while providing behavior at the same time. This
simplifies (in theory) testing of an application built with this pattern as the *ViewModel* has the lion's share of
data and behavior, and it's separated from the *View*. Perhaps the most interesting feature coming from this pattern is
the availability of a *Binder*, used to synchronize data between *View* and *ViewModel*.

[[_tutorial_5_1_4]]
=== PMVC: PresentationModel-View-Controller

The PMVC pattern is the ultimate variation of MVC, where we're back to the triangle but this time we've got clear links
between members. The *PresentationModel* is responsible for holding information used to display the application's data
and hints to how said data should be visualized, such as colors, fonts, etc. Similarly to MVVM, the *View* benefits from
a *Binder* that can tie data from the *PresentationModel* to the *View*'s UI elements. The *Controller* is now content
to manipulate the *PresentationModel* directly, completely oblivious about a specific *View*. This leads to a much more
testable outcome, as the *PresentationModel* and *Controller* are completely separate from the *View*.

== Implementations

It's time to get down with business. The following sections describe the implementation of each pattern using the
link:https://griffon-framework.org/[Griffon] framework. All applications use JavaFX as the toolkit of choice.

[[_tutorial_5_2_1]]
=== Common Files

Regardless of the pattern all UIs rely on FXML to describe the *View* in a declarative approach as much as possible.
The following FXML file is thus shared by all applications

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim"]
.griffon-app/resources/org/example/sample.fxml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/resources/org/example/sample.fxml[lines=20..-1]
----

Input data is transformed by a simple service class, also shared by all applications

[source,java]
.griffon-app/services/org/example/SampleService.java
----
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/services/org/example/SampleService.java[lines=16..-1]
----

Finally the i18n messages required by the service

[source,java]
.griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties
----
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties[lines=17..-1]
----

Alright, we can now have a look at each specific pattern.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_5_toc"] <<_tutorial_5_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_5_2_2]]
=== MVC

Let's begin with the *View*, as this is the pattern member the user will interact. The *View* in this case is pretty
straight forward, as it only needs to load the FXML file that contains the descriptive UI. However it also exposes two
UI elements (_input_ and _output_) in order for the *Controller* and *Model* to read data and supply updates.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java
----
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Connects user events to *Controller*
<2> Exposes UI elements

Next comes the *Model*, responsible for holding the data required by the *View*. Notice that this particular implementation
notifies the *View* using proper threading concerns, that is, data is pushed to the *View* only inside the UI thread.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java
----
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Notifies *View*

Finally we get to the *Controller*, where we can see how it reacts to user events (the click on a button), reads data from
the *View*, transforms said data, then sends it to the *Model*. As we saw earlier, the *Model* closes the circuit by updating
the *View*. You may be wondering, how is the connection established between *Controller* and *View*? If you look back at
the FXML file you'll notice that the button has an id equal to `sayHelloActionTarget`.  That name is really close to one
of the *Controller*'s public methods. Also, in the *View* there's a call to `connectActions` that takes a `controller`
argument. Here Griffon expects a naming convention (the name of the action method plus the name of the button's id), which
if followed correctly, will make the a connection between *Controller* and *View*.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java
----
include::{mvc}/griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Read input
<2> Transform data
<3> Set as output

Given the trivial nature of this application you may be wondering if it's worthwhile having a *Model* at all. And you may
be right, however the *Model* is shown here to compare the different implementations that follow.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_5_toc"] <<_tutorial_5_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_5_2_3]]
=== MVP

The *View* in this pattern is a passive one. Curiously enough we can implement it in the same way as we did with the MVC
pattern. The resulting *View* turns out to be exactly the same as before.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java
----
include::{mvp}/griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Connects user events to *Presenter*
<2> Exposes UI elements

We'll see some changes in the remaining pattern members. The *Model* is again just a data holder, with just a single
property that takes care of the output to be displayed. There's nothing more to it given that this class uses JavaFX
properties, and as such we'll use event listeners to let the *Model* notify the *Presenter* when a state change occurs.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java
----
include::{mvp}/griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java[lines=16..-1]
----

Next we get to the *Presenter*. Griffon allows MVC members to have any name you deem fit, however their
responsibilities must be clearly stated, using the `@ArtifactProviderFor` annotation and a given MVC interface. At the
moment of writing there's no `GriffonPresenter` interface, and it's likely there'll never be, as this example shows
the current types are more than enough to provide the required behavior

[source,java]
.griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SamplePresenter.java
----
include::{mvp}/griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SamplePresenter.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Read input
<2> Transform data
<3> Set as output
<4> Notifies *View*

Last but not least, we have to cover the application's configuration in terms of MVC definitions, given that we're using
`presenter` instead of `controller`.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----
include::{mvp}/griffon-app/conf/Config.java[lines=16..-1]
----

The configuration is quite flexible to allow us a simple rename.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_5_toc"] <<_tutorial_5_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_5_2_4]]
=== MVVM

On to the third pattern, MVVM. The *View* is again a passive one. A *Binder* makes it easy to keep data in sync between
the *View* and the *ViewModel*. I opted to make use of the *Binder* in the *View*, rendering it almost exactly the same
as in the previous two patterns.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java
----
include::{mvvm}/griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Connects user events to *ViewModel*
<2> Binds *ViewModel* and *View*

Now, the *ViewModel* contains data and behavior, essentially, a combination of *Model* and *Controller*/*Presenter* as
seen in previous patterns

[source,java]
.griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleViewModel.java
----
include::{mvvm}/griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleViewModel.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Read input
<2> Transform data
<3> Set as output

The configuration is shown next.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/conf/Config.java
----
include::{mvvm}/griffon-app/conf/Config.java[lines=16..-1]
----

In truth we could have had a *Model* member too, just like in the other pattern implementations. However MVVM prefers the
 *Model* to wrap a domain object or provide direct access to the data layer. As that's not the case for this trivial
application the *Model* disappears and the data properties are moved to the *ViewModel*. This also servers to showcase
that MVC configurations can have less members than the stereotypical three.

icon:arrow-up[link="#_tutorial_5_toc"] <<_tutorial_5_toc,Top>>

[[_tutorial_5_2_5]]
=== PMVC

Finally we meet the last pattern. We begin again with the *View*.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java
----
include::{pmvc}/griffon-app/views/org/example/SampleView.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Connects user events to *Controller*
<2> Binds *Model* and *View*

Opposed to the other implementations, this *View* makes direct use of the *Binder*, thus foregoing the need to expose
UI elements to other MVC members. In this way, the *View* is self contained and all of its links are properly established.

The *Model* goes back to being a simple data holder, but this time it contains properties for both _input_ and _output_,
as those define all the required data points.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java
----
include::{pmvc}/griffon-app/models/org/example/SampleModel.java[lines=16..-1]
----

The last member we must discuss is the *Controller* itself.

[source,java]
.griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java
----
include::{pmvc}/griffon-app/controllers/org/example/SampleController.java[lines=16..-1]
----
<1> Read input
<2> Transform data
<3> Set as output

This *Controller* has no need for a particular *View*, it only needs a *PresentationModel* that delivers the required
inputs and outputs. This greatly simplifies testing such components.

== Conclusions

As you can see, Griffon is flexible enough and can adapt itself to your preferred MVC pattern. There are other MVC variants,
such as the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Hierarchical model–view–controller],
which is also automatically supported, given that Griffon enables hierarchical MVC groups and per-group contexts.

The preferred pattern is PMVC, as that's the one suggested by the standatd Griffon archetypes.

The full code for these applications can be found
