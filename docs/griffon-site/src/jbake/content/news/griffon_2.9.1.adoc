== Griffon 2.9.1 Released

All artifacts from Griffon 2.9.0 shipped without debug information, this makes it virtually impossible to debug
applications inside IDEs. This release corrects this oversight.

There are no new features in this release.

We look forward to your feedback. Please report any problems you find to the Griffon User list,
or better yet, file a bug at http://github.com/griffon/griffon/issues
