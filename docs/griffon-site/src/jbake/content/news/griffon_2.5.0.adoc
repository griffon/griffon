== Griffon 2.5.0 Released

The Griffon team is happy to announce the release of Griffon 2.5.0!

The following list summarizes the changes brought by this release:

 * Upgraded to Groovy 2.4.5
 * A new interface, `ObservableContext`, allows publication of events when a property is added, removed, or updated.
 * `Context` now sports typed getters.
 * `Context` can inject any members annotated with `@Contextual` at any given time.
 * Contextual injections on MVC members are automatically cleanup up during the destroy lifecycle phase of each MVC member.
 * `JavaFXAction` has the following updates:
 ** a `visible` property that controls the visibility of the bound widget.
 ** a `styleClass` property that controls the stylable classes of the bound widget.
