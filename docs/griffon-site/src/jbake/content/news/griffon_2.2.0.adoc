== Griffon 2.2.0 Released

The Griffon team is happy to announce the release of Griffon 2.2.0!

The following list summarizes the changes brought by this release:

 * An application wide link:/guide/latest/api/griffon/core/Context.html[context, window="_blank"] that can be used to
   store key/value pairs.
 * MVCGroups can have their own contexts too.
 * MVCGroups now expose their parent group (if not null).
 * `Configuration` instances can be made writable by wrapping them with `MutableConfiguration`.
 * *breaking change!* Metadata, Environment and RunMode are no longer magic singletons.
   Instances of these classes can now be injected using `javax.inject.Inject`.

A more detailed description of the changes and compatibility issues can be found at the link:/releasenotes/griffon_2.2.0.html[release notes, window="_blank"].

We look forward to your feedback. Please report any problems you find to the Griffon User list,
