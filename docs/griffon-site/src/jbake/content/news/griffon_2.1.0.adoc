== Griffon 2.1.0 Released

The Griffon team is happy to announce the release of Griffon 2.1.0!

The following list summarizes the changes brought by this release:

 * MVC group management has been overhauled. It should be much easier and intuitive to work with MVC groups now.
 * Actions can have their properties updated at any time using `ActionHandlers`. Think for example updating an action's
   enabled state if its security constraints are not met.
 * Addons can supply startup groups.
 * Lazybones project templates have been updated.
 * Buildtime and runtime dependencies have been updated.

Be warned that changes made to `link:{path-griffon-core}/mvc/MVCGroup.html[MVCGroup, window="_blank"]` and
`link:{path-griffon-core}/mvc/MVCGroupManager.html[MVCGroupManager, window="_blank"]` break binary compatibility. Migration
should be straight forward, developers that make explicit use of the `buildMVCGroup`, `createMVCGroup`
and `withMVCGroup` methods should be the only ones concerned.

A more detailed description of the changes and compatibility issues can be found at the link:/releasenotes/griffon_2.1.0.html[release notes, window="_blank"].

We look forward to your feedback. Please report any problems you find to the Griffon User list,
or better yet, file a bug at https://github.com/griffon/griffon/issues

Many thanks to all who contributed to this release!

The Griffon Team
