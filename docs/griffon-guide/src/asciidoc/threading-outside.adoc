= Outside Calls

Making sure a block of code is executed outside the UI thread is made by invoking
the +execOutsideUI+ method. This method is smart enough to figure out if the unit
of work is already outside of the UI thread; otherwise it instructs the Griffon
runtime to runt he unit in a different thread. This is usually performed by a
helper +java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService+.
