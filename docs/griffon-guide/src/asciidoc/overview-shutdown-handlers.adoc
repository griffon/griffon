= Shutdown Handlers

Applications have the option to let particular artifacts abort the shutdown sequence
and/or perform a task while the shutdown sequence is in process. Artifacts that desire
to be part of the shutdown sequence should implement the +{link_shutdown_handler}+
interface and register themselves with the application instance.

The contract of a +{link_shutdown_handler}+ is very simple

* +boolean canShutdown(GriffonApplication application)+ - return *+false+* to abort the shutdown sequence.
* +void onShutdown(GriffonApplication application)+ - called if the shutdown sequence was not aborted.

++{link_shutdown_handler}++s will be called on the same order as they were registered.
