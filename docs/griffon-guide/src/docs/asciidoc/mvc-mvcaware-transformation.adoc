= The @MVCAware Transformation

Any component may gain the ability to create and destroy MVC groups through a `MVCGroupManager`
instance. You only need annotate the class with +{link_mvcaware}+
and it will automatically gain all methods exposed by +{link_mvchandler}+.

This feature is just a shortcut to avoid reaching for the application instance
from objects that do not hold a reference to it.

Here's an example of a custom bean that's able to work with MVC groups

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
@griffon.transform.MVCAware
class Bean {
}
----

This class can be used in the following way

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
class SampleService {
    @Inject Bean bean

    void buildSecondary(String groupName) {
        def (m, v, c) = bean.createMVCGroup(groupName)
        // do something with m, v and c
    }
}
----
