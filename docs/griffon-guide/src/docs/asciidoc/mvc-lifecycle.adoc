= MVC Lifecycle

All subclasses of `{link_griffon_mvcartifact}` (such as controllers, models, and views) have a basic lifecycle that complements
the lifecycle offered by the Depenendency Injection container. The following rules apply (in order):

.Initialization

1. The artifact's constructor is invoked by the DI container.
2. If a method is annotated with `@javax.annotation.PostConstruct` then it's invoked by the DI container.
3. All members (fields and setters) annotated with `{link_contextual}` are resolved and injected.
4. The `{link_mvc_group_manager}` invokes `{link_mvc_group_init}` on the artifact.

.Destruction

1. The `{link_mvc_group_manager}` invokes `{link_mvc_group_destroy}` on the artifact.
2. All members (fields and setters) annotated with `{link_contextual}` are set to `null`.
3. If a method is annotated with `@javax.annotation.PreDestroy` then it's invoked by the DI container.
