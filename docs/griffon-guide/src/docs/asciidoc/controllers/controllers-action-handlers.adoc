= Action Handlers

``{link_action_handler}``s open a new set of possibilities by allowing developers
and <<_addons,addon>> authors to define code that should be executed before and after
any controller action is invoked by the framework. For example, you may want to protect
the execution of a particular action given specific permissions; the `shiro` plugin uses
annotations that are handled by an `ActionHandler`, like this:

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import griffon.core.artifact.GriffonController
import griffon.core.controller.ControllerAction
import org.kordamp.jipsy.annotations.ServiceProviderFor
import griffon.plugins.shiro.annotation.*

@ServiceProviderFor(GriffonController)
@RequiresAuthentication
class PrinterController {
    @RequiresPermission('printer:print')
    @ControllerAction
    void print () { ... }

    @RequiresRoles('administrator')
    @ControllerAction
    void configure() { ... }
}
----

The `scaffolding` plugin on the other hand modifies the arguments sent to the action.
Take the following snippet for example

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import griffon.core.artifact.GriffonController
import griffon.core.controller.ControllerAction
import org.kordamp.jipsy.annotations.ServiceProviderFor
import griffon.plugins.shiro.annotation.*
import org.apache.shiro.authc.UsernamePasswordToken
impprt org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject
import javax.swing.JOptionPane

import javax.inject.Inject

@ServiceProviderFor(GriffonController)
class StrutsController {
    @Inject
    private Subject subject

    @RequiresGuest
    @ControllerAction
    void login(LoginCommandObject cmd) {
        try {
            subject.login(new UsernamePasswordToken(cmd.username, cmd.password))
        } catch(Exception e) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(
                app.windowManager.findWindow('mainWindow'),
                'Invalid username and/or password',
                'Security Failure', JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE)
        }
    }

    @RequiresAuthentication
    @ControllerAction
    void logout() {
        subject.logout()
    }
}
----

Note that the `login` action requires an instance of `LoginCommandObject`. The `scaffolding`
plugin is aware of this fact; it will create an instance of said class, wire up a scaffolded
view in a dialog and present it to the user. The `LoginCommandObject` instance will be set
as the action's arguments if it validates successfully, otherwise action execution is aborted.

== Implementing an Action Handler

Action handlers must implement the `{link_action_handler}` interface. There's a
handy base class (`org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.core.controller.AbstractActionHandler`)
that provides sensible defaults. Say you'd want to know how much time it took for an action
to be executed, also if an exception occurred during its execution. This handler could
be implemented as follows:

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
package com.acme

import griffon.core.controller.Action
import griffon.core.controller.ActionExecutionStatus
import org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.core.controller.AbstractActionHandler

import javax.inject.Named

@Named('tracer')
class TracerActionHandler extends AbstractActionHandler {
    private final Map<String, Long> TIMES = [:]

    Object[] before(Action action, Object[] args) {
        TIMES[action.fullyQuallifiedName] = System.currentTimeMillis()
        return super.before(controller, actionName, args)
    }

    Object after(ActionExecutionStatus status, Action action, Object[] args, Object result) {
        long time = System.currentTimeMillis() - TIMES[action.fullyQuallifiedName]
        println("Action ${action.fullyQuallifiedName} took ${time} ms [${status}]")
        result
    }
}
----

The `{link_action_handler}`  interface defines a handful of methods that are invoked
by the `{link_action_manager}` at very specific points during the lifetime and execution
of controller actions.

void configure(Action action, Method method):: The `configure()` method is called during
the configuration phase, when the `ActionManager` creates the actions. This method is
called once in the lifetime of an action.
void update(Action action):: The `update()` method can be called at any time. Its responsibility
is to update the action's properties, such as the enabled state, given the current state
of the application.
Object[] before(Action action, Object[] args):: The `before()` method is executed every
time an action is about to be invoked. This method is responsible for adjusting the
arguments (if needed) or aborting the action execution altogether. Any exception thrown
by an handler in this method will halt action execution however only `{link_abort_execution_exception}`
is interpreted as a graceful abort.
boolean exception(Exception exception, Action action, Object[] args):: The `exception()`
method is invoked only when an exception occurred during the action's execution.
Implementors must return `true` if the exception was handled successfully. The exception will
be rethrown by the `ActionManager` if no handler handled the exception. This happens as the
last step of the action interception procedure.
Object after(ActionExecutionStatus status, Action axtion, Object[] args, Object result):: The `after()` method
is called after an action has been executed. Any exceptions occurred during the action's
execution should have been handled by `exception()`. The `status` argument specifies if
the action was successfully executed (`OK`), if it was aborted by an handler (`ABORTERD`)
or if an exception occurred during its execution (`EXCEPTION`).

Action handlers can participate in Dependency Injection.

== Configuration

Action Handlers must be registered within a `{link_module}` in order to be picked
up by the `ActionManager`. The following example shows how the previous `TracerActionHandler`
can be registered in a `Module`:

.src/main/com/acme/ApplicationModule.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
package com.acme

import griffon.core.injection.Module
import griffon.core.controller.ActionHandler
import org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.core.injection.AbstractModule
import org.kordamp.jipsy.annotations.ServiceProviderFor

import javax.inject.Named

@ServiceProviderFor(Module)
@Named('application')
public class ApplicationModule extends AbstractModule {
    @Override
    protected void doConfigure() {
        bind(ActionHandler)
            .to(TracerActionHandler)
            .asSingleton()
    }
}
----

A Handler may define a dependency on another handler; use the `{link_depends_on}`
annotation to express the relationship.

It's also possible to globally override the order of execution of handlers, or
define an order when handlers are orthogonal. Take for example the `security`
handler provided by the `shiro` plugin and the `scaffolding` handler provided by
`scaffolding` plugin. These handlers know nothing about each other; however, `security`
should be called before `scaffolding`. This can be accomplished by adding the following
snippet to `Config.groovy`:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
griffon.controller.action.handler.order = ['security', 'scaffolding']
