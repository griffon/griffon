[[_views_lanterna]]
= Lanterna Specific

{link_lanterna} is a Java library allowing you to write easy semi-graphical user interfaces
in a text-only environment, very similar to the C library curses but with more
functionality. Lanterna supports xterm compatible terminals and terminal emulators
such as konsole, gnome-terminal, putty, xterm and many more. One of the main benefits
of lanterna is that it's not dependent on any native library but runs 100% in pure Java.

Refer to the <<_builder_nodes_lanterna,list of nodes>> that become available when
the +griffon-lanterna-groovy-{griffon-version}.jar+ is added as a dependency.
