= Events

Applications have the ability to publish events from time to time to communicate
that something of interest has happened at runtime. Events will be triggered by
the application during each of its life cycle phases, also when MVC groups are
created and destroyed.

NOTE: All application event handlers are guaranteed to be called in the same thread
that originated the event.
